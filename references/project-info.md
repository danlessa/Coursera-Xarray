    - Project description
        - By the end of this project, you will be able to load, visualize, manipulate and perform both simple and grouped operations over geospatial multidimensional data through Xarray and Python.  
        - We'll explore an dataset containing temperature, vegetation density and total precipitation over the Brazilian Amazon for the 1979-2019 period while the concepts are developed. 
        - This will enable the learner to handle and extract knowledge from complex datasets such as the ones from satellite and climate re-analysis. observations.
    - Target learner
        - This guided project will benefit data scientists, data analysts and geophysical researchers who must deal with multidimensional / geospatial datasets. Also, this topic can be of interest for computational economists, meteorologists, environment researchers, public health analysts and among others.
    - Project prerequisites
        - This project requires a basic familiarity with using Python and Pandas.
